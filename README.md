# GameDatabase

This application will give our users the ability to search games by their
name and ID. The game will be issued an unique ID and he/she will be able
to access all data about this game, including genres, game platforms,
publishers and where their headquarters are located. Also, the user will have
the abilities to manually add a game to our database and to also add a
specific genre or game platform to the game. Furthermore, the user will also
have the ability to update a game’s name, or remove the game from the
database as deemed fit. The user is also able to view statistics of the sales
per year of a game.
